title: MTA Turnstile Analysis
---

## Background:

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) hosts annual gala in New York City at the end of May each year in order to connect workers in technology. The goal of the gala is to increase the participation of women in technology and build awareness and outreach. The organization is interested in harnessing the power of data analytics to optimize the effectiveness of street team work, which is crucial to their fundraising efforts. The street team will be placed at the entrances to subway stations to market the event.

## Approach:

By analyzing the MTA subway and demographics data of the city, the optimal approach can be generated to increase publicity of the gala.

The data for this problem were taken from the following sources:

* [Metropolitan Transit Authority](http://www.mta.info/)
* [NYC Census Factfinder](http://maps.nyc.gov/census/)
* [Digital NYC](http://www.digital.nyc/)
