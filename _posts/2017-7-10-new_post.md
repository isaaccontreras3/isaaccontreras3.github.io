![_config.yml]({{ https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/26/26-subway-map-1.nocrop.w536.h2147483647.jpg}}/images/config.png)

## Background:

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) hosts annual gala in New York City at the end of May each year in order to connect workers in technology. The goal of the gala is to increase the participation of women in technology and build awareness and outreach. The organization is interested in harnessing the power of data analytics to optimize the effectiveness of street team work, which is crucial to their fundraising efforts. The street team will be placed at the entrances to subway stations to market the event.

## Approach:

By analyzing the MTA subway and demographics data of the city, the optimal strategy for the street team can be solved to increase publicity of the gala. In order to predict the ridership behavior of the current year, the data from May of the previous year will be used.

The following sources are used to generate the data:

* [Metropolitan Transit Authority](http://www.mta.info/)
* [NYC Census Factfinder](http://maps.nyc.gov/census/)
* [Digital NYC](http://www.digital.nyc/)

The following map of New York City shows tech companies in blue dots. By observation, there are two major tech hubs: Silicon Alley and Lower Manhattan. Columbia University is another area which can attract aspiring women workers in technology. These are the three regions of focus where the station ridership data will be generated.

## Analysis:

* Find count (Entries + Exits) per 4 hours for each turnstile
* Find count per day for each turnstile

* Generate the top 10 stations based on the demographics and region

* Remove audits with unrealistic amount of entries, set max entries to 10000 per day
